Hey There! I am a ECE student from the 2018 batch. I love to code and build amazing web apps which might help some people out. I have primarily worked with MERN stack and occasionally with TypeScript, Python and React Native. I also like to do a bit of Competitive Coding.

## Projects

-   **P.S. It's Easy** - A Web Application to help in all BITS Practice School Allotment processes. From viewing past years' responses, CG cutoffs, chronicles to sorting/filtering the latest Project Banks wrt stipend, branch, etc. in a clean dark user-friendly UI.
